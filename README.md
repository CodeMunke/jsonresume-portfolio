# Portfolio complex (CV + Resume)

A site-portfolio designed to streamline the resume and CV generation process based on two [JSONResume](https://jsonresume.org/) themes and a little bit of CSS/JS greasing.

## Architecture

The site consists of three modules:

1) **Main/CV module**: for portfolio serving and CV generation. It uses the [Elegant](https://github.com/mudassir0909/jsonresume-theme-elegant) JSONResume theme as base. Written using JS and LESS + Pug/Jade.
2) **Resume module**: made for serving and generation of the **truncated one-page resume**. Based on the [OnePage](https://github.com/ainsleyc/jsonresume-theme-onepage) JSONResume theme. Extremely simplistic, written in JS + CSS + HBS placed in `assets/onepage/`;
3) **Backend module**: made to serve and handle the above frontend modules. Made with NodeJS. Located entirely within `server.mjs`.

***The project uses `.env` environment variables, don't forget to define them!***

## How to deploy

### **Define resume.json**

Make your own resume.json like specified in `resume_example.json` and either referece it in your file system or host it elsewhere (I, for example, host it on GitHub gists). There are key differences between the usual `resume.json` format and this one:

* It has and uses `resume.basics.objective`, the objective of your job search;
* Uses `resume.picture` instead of `resume.image`;
* Since this project is based on the Elegant theme, [which supports Markdown rendering](https://github.com/mudassir0909/jsonresume-theme-elegant#markdown-supported) you can format your text in this way;
* It uses `resume.work[i].url` instead of `resume.work[i].website`;
* The server truncates everything in `resume.json` that is placed between the [word joiners](https://unicode-table.com/en/2060/) when it renders the resume. ***They won't be removed when rendering the full CV.*** Example:
  >I'm rendering a truncated one-page resume for these HR people‚Å†;~~ but my resume.json is too large!‚Å†~~ Thankfully, the server removes the last bit between the word joiners.

### **Prepare the project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeMunke/jsonresume-portfolio.git
npm install -g grunt
npm install -g pug-cli
cd jsonresume-portfolio
npm install
```

Then, create the `.env` file:

```bash
touch .env
```

And define 2 variables there:

```bash
#Serving port.
PORT=3000

#URL to resume.json
JSONRESUME_URL="your_link_here"
```

### **Build and run!**

```bash
#To build AND serve
$ grunt serve
...
Serving CV at: http://localhost:{PORT}/
Serving resume at: http://localhost:{PORT}/{resumeEndpoint}

#To build only
grunt build

#To serve only
$ grunt exec:run_server
...
Serving CV at: http://localhost:{PORT}/
Serving resume at: http://localhost:{PORT}/{resumeEndpoint}
```

**And now, for the fun stuff!**

## Feature overview

1) The key feature of this portfolio complex is that it has TWO buttons:
   * *Download resume*
   * *Download full CV*
  
Both of them export the CV and truncated resume into neat PDFs, yay! üòÑ
